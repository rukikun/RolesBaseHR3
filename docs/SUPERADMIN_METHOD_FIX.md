# isSuperAdmin() Method Fix

## Problem
The system was throwing a `BadMethodCallException` error:
```
Call to undefined method App\Models\Employee::isSuperAdmin()
```

This error occurred because the views were calling `Auth::user()->isSuperAdmin()` but the Employee model didn't have this method defined.

## Root Cause
- The system was converted from using `users` table to `employees` table for authentication
- The `User` model had the `isSuperAdmin()` method but the `Employee` model was missing it
- Views in `resources/views/layouts/hr.blade.php` and `resources/views/dashboard/admin.blade.php` were calling this method

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Methods to Employee Model
Added the following methods to `app/Models/Employee.php`:

```php
public function isSuperAdmin()
{
    // In our employee system, 'admin' role is equivalent to super admin
    return $this->role === 'admin';
}

public function canManageAdmins()
{
    // Only admin role can manage other admins
    return $this->role === 'admin';
}
```

### 2. Role Mapping
- In the `User` model: `isSuperAdmin()` checks for `'super_admin'` role
- In the `Employee` model: `isSuperAdmin()` checks for `'admin'` role
- This maintains consistency with our role-based system where `'admin'` is the highest privilege level

### 3. Cleared Caches
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

## Files Modified
- `app/Models/Employee.php` - Added `isSuperAdmin()` and `canManageAdmins()` methods

## Testing
Created and ran `test_superadmin_fix.php` to verify:
- ✅ Admin employees return `true` for `isSuperAdmin()`
- ✅ HR employees return `false` for `isSuperAdmin()`
- ✅ Regular employees return `false` for `isSuperAdmin()`
- ✅ Method exists and works correctly

## Usage in Views
The method is used in views to conditionally show admin-only features:

```blade
@if(Auth::user()->isSuperAdmin())
    <a href="{{ route('admin.profile.manage-admins') }}" class="list-group-item">
        <i class="fas fa-users-cog me-3"></i> Manage Admins
    </a>
@endif
```

## Result
- ✅ Error resolved
- ✅ Role-based access control working
- ✅ Admin features properly restricted
- ✅ System fully functional

The `isSuperAdmin()` method now works correctly with the role-based authentication system using the employees table.
