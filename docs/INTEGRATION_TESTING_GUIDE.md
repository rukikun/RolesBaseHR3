# Employee-Timesheet Integration Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the integrated Employee and Timesheet Management system in the HR3 application.

## Status Property Error Resolution

### ✅ **Fixed Issues**
1. **Undefined property: stdClass::$status** - Resolved with defensive programming
2. **Database query protection** - Added COALESCE for missing status values
3. **Blade template safety** - Added isset() checks for all status property access
4. **Route configuration** - Updated to use TimesheetController properly

## Integration Features to Test

### 1. **Employee-Timesheet Cross Navigation**
- **View Timesheets Button**: Click "View Timesheets" on any employee record
  - Should switch to Timesheets tab
  - Should filter timesheets by selected employee
  - Should display employee name in filter

- **Add Timesheet Button**: Click "Add Timesheet" for any employee
  - Should open timesheet modal
  - Should pre-select the employee in dropdown
  - Should allow immediate timesheet creation

### 2. **Employee Statistics Integration**
Test the Employee Statistics cards display:
- **Total Employees**: Count of all employee records
- **Active Employees**: Count of employees with status = 'active'
- **Employees with Timesheets**: Count of employees who have timesheet entries
- **Department Count**: Number of unique departments

### 3. **Status Property Handling**
Verify status displays correctly:
- **Pending timesheets**: Yellow badge with "Pending" text
- **Approved timesheets**: Green badge with "Approved" text
- **Rejected timesheets**: Red badge with "Rejected" text
- **Missing status**: Should show "Unknown" instead of error

### 4. **Database Integration**
- **Foreign Key Relationship**: employee_id in time_entries references employees.id
- **Cascade Delete**: Deleting employee should remove associated timesheets
- **Data Consistency**: Employee names should match between modules

## Testing Procedures

### **Pre-Testing Setup**
1. Ensure XAMPP MySQL is running
2. Run the database fix script if needed:
   ```sql
   -- Execute fix_timesheet_status.sql in phpMyAdmin or MySQL command line
   ```
3. Access the application at `/timesheet-management`

### **Test Case 1: Basic Navigation**
1. Navigate to Timesheet Management page
2. Verify both Timesheets and Employees tabs are visible
3. Switch between tabs - should load data without errors
4. Check for any console errors or PHP exceptions

### **Test Case 2: Employee-Timesheet Integration**
1. Go to Employees tab
2. Click "View Timesheets" for an employee with existing timesheets
3. Verify it switches to Timesheets tab and filters correctly
4. Click "Add Timesheet" for an employee
5. Verify modal opens with employee pre-selected

### **Test Case 3: Status Property Display**
1. View timesheet records in the table
2. Verify all status badges display correctly (no "Undefined property" errors)
3. Check different status types: pending, approved, rejected
4. Verify status filtering works in the dropdown

### **Test Case 4: CRUD Operations**
1. **Create**: Add new timesheet via modal form
2. **Read**: View timesheet details
3. **Update**: Edit existing timesheet
4. **Delete**: Remove timesheet with confirmation
5. **Approve/Reject**: Test workflow buttons

### **Test Case 5: Data Validation**
1. Try submitting empty forms - should show validation errors
2. Test invalid data (negative hours, future dates)
3. Verify CSRF protection is working
4. Check database constraints are enforced

## Expected Results

### **Success Indicators**
- ✅ No "Undefined property: stdClass::$status" errors
- ✅ Employee statistics update correctly
- ✅ Cross-module navigation works seamlessly
- ✅ All CRUD operations complete successfully
- ✅ Status badges display with correct colors
- ✅ Form validation prevents invalid data

### **Error Scenarios to Handle**
- Missing database tables (graceful degradation)
- NULL status values (defaults to 'pending')
- Missing employee records (shows Employee #ID)
- Network/database connection issues

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Status property errors**: Run `fix_timesheet_status.sql`
2. **Missing employees**: Check employees table exists and has active records
3. **Modal not working**: Verify working-modal CSS is included
4. **AJAX errors**: Check API routes are properly configured

### **Database Verification Queries**
```sql
-- Check time_entries table structure
DESCRIBE time_entries;

-- Verify status column exists and has values
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM time_entries GROUP BY status;

-- Check employee-timesheet relationships
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, COUNT(t.id) as timesheet_count
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN time_entries t ON e.id = t.employee_id 
GROUP BY e.id;
```

## Performance Considerations
- Employee dropdown should load quickly (< 1 second)
- Timesheet filtering should be responsive
- Tab switching should be instant
- Large datasets (>1000 records) may need pagination

## Security Checklist
- ✅ CSRF tokens on all forms
- ✅ Input validation on server-side
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ✅ Authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Proper error handling without data exposure
