# Department Options Update

## Overview
Successfully updated the department dropdown options in the profile edit form to reflect the new organizational structure with 5 specific departments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Edit Form (`edit.blade.php`)

**Department Dropdown Updated:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<option value="HR">Human Resources</option>
<option value="IT">Information Technology</option>
<option value="Finance">Finance</option>
<option value="Marketing">Marketing</option>
<option value="Operations">Operations</option>
<option value="Sales">Sales</option>

<!-- After -->
<option value="Human Resource">Human Resource</option>
<option value="Core Human">Core Human</option>
<option value="Logistics">Logistics</option>
<option value="Administration">Administration</option>
<option value="Finance">Finance</option>
```

### 2. Controller Validation (`AdminProfileController.php`)

**Validation Rules Updated:**
```php
// Before
'department' => 'nullable|string|max:100',

// After
'department' => 'nullable|in:Human Resource,Core Human,Logistics,Administration,Finance',
```

## New Department Structure

### Department Options:
1. **Human Resource** - HR management and employee relations
2. **Core Human** - Core human resources functions
3. **Logistics** - Supply chain and logistics operations
4. **Administration** - Administrative and support functions
5. **Finance** - Financial management and accounting

## Technical Implementation

### Form Validation:
- Department field now restricted to specific values only
- Prevents invalid department entries
- Maintains data consistency across the system

### Database Integration:
- Department values stored exactly as selected
- Profile displays show the full department names
- Existing employee records remain unchanged until updated

### User Experience:
- Clean dropdown with 5 specific options
- Clear department names without abbreviations
- Consistent naming convention across the system

## Files Modified

1. **View**: `resources/views/admin/profile/edit.blade.php`
   - Updated department dropdown options
   - Changed from 6 to 5 department options
   - Updated option values and display names

2. **Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/AdminProfileController.php`
   - Updated validation rules for department field
   - Changed from generic string to specific enum validation

3. **Testing**: `test_department_changes.php`
   - Verification script for department changes

## Migration Considerations

### Existing Data:
- Employees with old department values will retain them until manually updated
- New employees must select from the 5 new department options
- Profile edit form will show current department if it matches new options

### Data Cleanup (if needed):
If you need to migrate existing employee departments, you could run:
```sql
-- Example migration queries (run if needed)
UPDATE employees SET department = 'Human Resource' WHERE department = 'HR';
UPDATE employees SET department = 'Administration' WHERE department = 'IT';
-- Add other mappings as needed
```

## Validation Rules

### Department Field:
```php
'department' => 'nullable|in:Human Resource,Core Human,Logistics,Administration,Finance'
```

### Benefits:
- **Data Integrity**: Only valid departments can be selected
- **Consistency**: Standardized department names across system
- **User-Friendly**: Clear, descriptive department names
- **Validation**: Server-side validation prevents invalid entries

## Result
